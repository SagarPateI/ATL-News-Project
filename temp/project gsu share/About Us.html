    <p>Welcome to GSU Share, your go-to resource for free and valuable resources available to Georgia State University's
        students! We are a team of passionate students who believe that every student should have access to the tools
        and resources they need to succeed in their academic journey.</p>
    <p>Our mission is to spread awareness about the many free resources available to Georgia State University's
        students, including study materials, academic support services, financial aid, career services, and more. We
        understand that navigating college can be challenging, especially if you are on a tight budget. That's why we
        are committed to providing you with all the information you need to make the most of the resources available to
        you.</p>
    <p>At GSU Share, we believe that knowledge should be shared freely, and we are committed to making our website a
        platform for collective learning. We encourage all students to contribute to our website by sharing their
        experiences, resources, and insights. Together, we can create a community of learners who support each other and
        work towards a common goal.</p>
    <p>We are a team of students who share a common goal: to empower our fellow students with the knowledge and tools
